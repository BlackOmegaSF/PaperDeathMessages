# Death Messages
  
Adds some custom death messages, adds coordinates to all death messages, and can log death messages for selected players.
  
If you're using my custom resource pack, this plugin will also play the classic oof sound when a player dies.
  
To log player deaths, run the command /logdeaths &lt;start|stop|list&gt; &lt;player&gt;

Death messages will be logged to a file in the server's root folder: [player]Deaths.log
